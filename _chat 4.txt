[10/25/25, 11:02:53 AM] Raj Kothari: Hello everyone,

Thank you all for showing interest and enthusiasm in hosting JCL Season 3! Let’s work together to make this season a memorable one for everyone involved.

Before we dive into the tournament details, I’d like to share a few key principles that will guide how we plan and execute everything:

1. Participation:
Committee ke sab members tournament me sirf auction ke through participate karenge.
Koi bhi member team owner nahi ban sakta aur base player bhi nahi hoga (agar base player system continue karne ka decide huai).

2. Ownership of Responsibilities:
Har member ko ek specific responsibility di jayegi.
Apna task poora end-to-end own karna hai — planning se leke execution tak.
Kaam time par aur ache se complete karna sabse important hai ✅

3. Meetings & Coordination:
Sabke time ka respect karte hue, har meeting ke pehle ek poll aayega jisme availability confirm karni hai.
Meeting tab start hogi jab 50% members present honge.
Please try to come 5 mins early 🙏
Jo bhi key decisions aur updates honge, wo group me share kar diye jayenge.

4. Tracking Progress:
Har meeting ke sath ek timeline sheet + agenda share hoga.
Jiske paas particular task hai, wo apne updates dega aur agar kisi cheez par sabka opinion chahiye hoga to wo group me discuss hoga.

Let’s keep things simple, transparent, aur fun 😄

[10/28/25, 11:33:36 AM] Jay Baid Chandrapur: In place of this we can do one thing, to make it compulsory that the team must use the impact rule every match they playing. 
So that the extra players who don’t get the chance even to enter the field get a chance to play atleast one match through out the tournament.
[10/28/25, 11:37:12 AM] Ansh Doshi Chandrapur: That's the responsibility of team owner/captain not Committee....how can committee be involved in selecting players to take field for any team ‎<This message was edited>
[10/28/25, 11:39:20 AM] Jay Baid Chandrapur: For that reason we can make the impact rule compulsory
[10/28/25, 11:39:30 AM] Deepak Golechha Bhaiyya Chandrapur: Bonus over ka feature bhi laa sakte hai 
Batting side gets to select one over, during the innings as bonus over ,they need to set a minimum target of runs scored in the over ,and if they active it the runs will be doubled or else all runs scored in that over will be cancelled..
[10/28/25, 11:40:22 AM] Deepak Golechha Bhaiyya Chandrapur: Thoda aur refine kar lenge discuss kar ke
[10/28/25, 11:40:30 AM] Ojas Pugliya Chandrapur: Wo stats update karne me problem dega
[10/28/25, 11:41:05 AM] Ojas Pugliya Chandrapur: Online jo stats update karte scorecard wha ye option set nhi kar sakte
[10/28/25, 11:41:06 AM] Jay Baid Chandrapur: We can keep the points in mind and discuss it in the meeting
[10/28/25, 11:42:30 AM] Ansh Doshi Chandrapur: Impact player will also only allow 9 players to play while teams will be of 10-11 players minimum so still it won't guarantee that every player in the team will get to play so making such rule will be mostly unnecessary
[10/28/25, 11:44:01 AM] Jay Baid Chandrapur: Let’s keep this points with us and get a conclusion in the upcoming meet ‎<This message was edited>

Should we have a Bowling Powerplay?

‎OPTION: No Bowling Powerplay (6 votes)
‎OPTION: Something else (0 votes)
[10/29/25, 11:37:40 AM] Raj Kothari: **Forced Batsman Swap**

The bowling team selects a non-striking batsman to replace one of the current batsmen for the entire over.

If the substitute batsman gets out, the bowling team can select a second non-striker to replace the remaining current batsman.

The original two batsmen return to the crease once the powerplay over is complete.

[10/29/25, 12:05:51 PM] Ojas Pugliya Chandrapur: Headache wali chiz ho jayegi
Matlab nhi hai
[10/29/25, 12:06:58 PM] Pranay: Here's my take on the batting and bowling powerplay 
If we are having a batting powerplay we should also have a bowling one.
 
In batting power play if we are having it for 2 overs then we should have 3 fielders on the boundary lines and if only one over then we can think of 2 fielders on the boundary line. 

In bowling powerplay 
We can add 5 fielders. For one over 
Or we can introduce one more rule 

If the ball lands on the 2-run spot first and then goes to the boundary wall, it's still only 2 runs. And if the ball hits the net above the turf before going to the boundary, it's still 4 runs."
I think this will be fair for baller at atleast will be able to save certain runs
[10/29/25, 12:16:50 PM] Pratik Kothari Chandrapur: 2/4/6 jo hai vo turf ke rules hi hai to usko chhedna koi matlab nhi banata
[10/29/25, 12:17:57 PM] Pratik Kothari Chandrapur: Usko as it is rakho
[10/29/25, 12:17:58 PM] Ansh Doshi Chandrapur: Bhaiya baaki tournaments me normally sirf 3 fielders rehte hai boundary pe pure match me batting pp me 2 overs me 2 hi fielder rehne chahiye tabhi Mtlb hai batting pp ka
[10/29/25, 12:18:38 PM] Ansh Doshi Chandrapur: And bowling pp me bhi 5 fielders bohot zyada hai 4 me hi apne kitne catches chale jaate

[10/29/25, 1:02:57 PM] Pranay: Bhai tum sirf batting point of view se mat Sochi
[10/29/25, 1:03:42 PM] Pranay: Otherwise koi bhi powerplay mat rakho
[10/29/25, 1:05:43 PM] Pranay: Bhaiya wo isiliye bola kyu ki batting powerplay hai toh balling bhi hona chahiye aur isiliye woh rule k liye bola mai sirf  ek over k liye hai wo ya 2 over jitna batting powerplay rahega utna hi bowling powerplay
[10/29/25, 1:06:55 PM] Ansh Doshi Chandrapur: Bhaiya koi bhi turf tournament me bowling pp nhi rehta turf cricket hai hi batsmen favouring

[10/29/25, 6:06:42 PM] Raj Kothari: I agree
[10/29/25, 6:08:46 PM] Raj Kothari: It is important to make decisions on these rules on whatsapp itself because these rules are not the most critical part of the game but will eat away half the time of our in-person discussion if left open-ended.
[10/29/25, 6:44:13 PM] Pranay: My suggestion is that if we are having batting powerplay we should also have a bowling powerplay, reason behind that there is already a lot for batters even without introducing powerplay then introducing it will be more in favour of the batsmen. You also need to think of the bowlers
[10/29/25, 7:02:35 PM] Raj Kothari: Usi ke liye ye vaala poll tha na pranay. Bowling powerplay ke ideas bowler ko advantage kam de rahe hai but rules ko zyada complex bana rahe hai. At the end, humko majority ke hisaab se chalna zaruri hai
[10/29/25, 7:25:30 PM] Nirav Bohra Chandrapur: 4 fielders boht h Already ; 5th fielder ki jagah bhi nhi rehengi jaake ekbar dekho turf pe
[10/29/25, 7:27:13 PM] Rahul Gandhi Chandrapur: I agree
[10/29/25, 7:29:04 PM] Shreyans Bhai Kothari: Plus fielders ke bich me misunderstanding aur confusion alag hoga
[10/29/25, 7:29:38 PM] Ansh Doshi Chandrapur: Aur takra bhi sakte ek dusre se
[10/29/25, 7:29:44 PM] Raj Kothari: 1. Bowling powerplay implement karne ke liye 60% vote lagenge kyuki ye naya rule la rahe apan
2. ⁠4 bhi rakh sakte na fielders, ya to aage peeche karke 5 rakhlo.. ‎<This message was edited>

[10/29/25, 7:48:56 PM] Nirav Bohra Chandrapur: Waisa he rehta re
[10/29/25, 7:48:57 PM] Ojas Pugliya Chandrapur: Matlab powerplay me team ka best bowler bowling karne aayega

We will not be providing unsold player with Tshirt or any other add ons so it will be better to refund the money in that case. ‎<This message was edited>
[11/1/25, 2:19:16 PM] Raj Kothari: Agar kisi ko koi question nahi hai ispe to ye update kar sakte hai form me
[11/1/25, 2:32:55 PM] Raj Kothari: ‎POLL:
Should we allow ownership transfers? (eg. Chandralok giving their spot to a new team owner)
‎OPTION: Yes (1 vote)
‎OPTION: No (9 votes)
[11/1/25, 2:33:59 PM] Raj Kothari: Some thoughts
*PROS* (Why we SHOULD allow transfers):

Rewards Owner's Effort: The owner earned that high rank. This gives them a say in who takes their place.

Owner's Choice: Lets an owner pass their spot to a friend or someone they know will be a good addition to the league.

Keeps Team Names: We can keep familiar team names in the JCL, just with a new owner.

*CONS* (Why we SHOULD NOT allow transfers):

Weakens the Priority List: It lets people "skip the line," which goes against our performance-based priority system.

Unfair to Waiting Teams: It's not fair to the teams at #3, #4, #5, etc., who earned their spot in the queue and are waiting their turn.

Could Lead to "Selling Spots": We want to avoid spots being sold for money. For a community tournament, spots should be earned.
[11/1/25, 2:34:04 PM] Jay Baid Chandrapur: Phir unke recommended walo ko hi dege ya jo first aaege unko?
[11/1/25, 2:37:37 PM] Ansh Doshi Chandrapur: Do we have waiting teams?
[11/1/25, 2:39:15 PM] Pratik Kothari Chandrapur: Agar franchise transfer ho rahi hai same name se to its ok... Lekin agar koi naye naam se team banana chahta hai to usko *point 3 new team/new owner* ke hisab se hi priority dena chahiye
[11/1/25, 2:41:32 PM] Pratik Kothari Chandrapur: Ye kar sakte hai jo intrested hai unke first come first served basis par list banakar rakh sakte hai jaise hi koi onwership chhode unko mil jayegi
[11/1/25, 3:13:51 PM] Pankajbhaiya Mutha Chandrapur: To keep things simple, please check with the previous team owners to see if they wish to continue for this year’s JPL'2025. 

If any teams opt out, announce the availability of the remaining slots on a first-come, first-served basis.
[11/1/25, 3:14:32 PM] Piyush Dugad Bhaiyya: Perfect
[11/1/25, 3:27:01 PM] Deepak Golechha Bhaiyya Chandrapur: 👍
[11/1/25, 3:27:02 PM] Deepak Golechha Bhaiyya Chandrapur: This is a good point and should be considered..
If player goes unsold we should refund him , maybe wait till the actual start of  tournament..

[11/1/25, 8:04:22 PM] Raj Kothari: Okay👍🏾
Isme bhi fir ek cheez decide karna padega. Apan har saal allow kar rahe ki team owner khudko auction me rakhke apne 2 base players rakh sakta hai.. is saal bhi vaise hi rakhna hai kya? Kyuki ye rule me loopholes nikaale ja sakte hai..
[11/1/25, 8:16:49 PM] Piyush Dugad Bhaiyya: Bhai atleast is type ki responsibility @⁨Chintu Pugliya Bhaiyya⁩ @⁨Pratik Kothari Chandrapur⁩ @⁨Raj Kothari⁩

[11/2/25, 9:56:10 AM] Raj Kothari: ‎POLL:
Meeting at 4:30 pm
‎OPTION: Yes (7 votes)
‎OPTION: No (6 votes)
[11/2/25, 10:22:07 AM] Raj Kothari: We need to finalize our stance on JCL team ownership transfers. As discussed, while the initial vote was 'no' for transfers, we have some practical scenarios to consider to avoid future issues.

Please share your unbiased opinion on the three options below:

*Strict Rule*: NO Owner change AND NO Team Name change. (Ensures priority list integrity, but restricts joint/family ownership changes).

*Flexible Rule*: Allows EITHER Owner change OR Team Name change (but not both). (A balanced approach to prevent misuse by lower-priority teams).

*Most Lenient*: Allows BOTH Owner change AND Team Name change. (Gives full authority to the owner, but the committee loses control over which teams participate).

Your input is crucial. Let's aim to conclude this discussion. While replying on this, please first write the option that you favour and then write supporting arguments and counter arguments. We need to conclude the same in today’s meeting
[11/2/25, 10:32:38 AM] Palash Singhvi Chandrapur: For me *Flexible Rule* is Fine. We can't be strict in this matter atleast. FLEXIBLE RULE makes a Balance between Commitee and  Owners. If a Owners Owns a Team he can atleast change the Name of team because of any reason or If a Team name is same he can atleast give ownership to his family mates for any reason, maybe he's not available or any other scenario. ‎<This message was edited>

[11/3/25, 11:05:44 AM] Piyush Dugad Bhaiyya: Bhaiya aapke text me thoda vice-versa hai 🙏🏼
[11/3/25, 11:16:09 AM] Piyush Dugad Bhaiyya: Team owners ko call karne ke pehle 

1) Team own amt
2) Winning Amt n all
3) Criteria for auction points

Pls mention Above 3 points
[11/3/25, 11:17:42 AM] Piyush Dugad Bhaiyya: Aap baadme bologe team owner ko ke
Aap participate nhi kar sakte / above 40 base player / below 40 base player / above 40 itne player / below 40 itne players 
Ye sab pehle hi clear karna chahiye 🙏🏼
[11/3/25, 8:28:40 PM] Raj Kothari: Apan ne abhi old owners se confirmation liye hai unko sabko amount bataaye hai, winning amount bhi decide karke bata denge. Baaki auctioning related rules to apan pichle saal jaise hi rakh rahe hai
[11/3/25, 8:55:02 PM] Raj Kothari: Everything we did in the previous seasons was top tier - from the way sponsorships were handled to the on-field promotions and management. This is evident from the previous season’s tournament feedback

Building on that foundation, here are some thoughts that we can discuss to maximize sponsorer’s ROI. 

1. Be transparent with sponsors - let them know they’re contributing to a community cause rather than pure marketing.
2. Find and Collaborate with local influencers like ghumne-wali, Pratik Wadhai. Ask them to create content around unity of jain community that resonates very well with Jains and is acknowledged by other communities. Find and talk to Jain instagram influencers (like @unity_of_jains, @jainmedia) to create reels that could be used to promote the tournament further.
3. Partner with cricket-based Instagram pages to showcase JCL more widely.
4. Start growing our JCL Instagram account year-round with cricket + community content, so in the long run, our sponsorship value becomes even stronger.
5. ⁠Create a JCL - All Stars team and participate in other leagues and tournaments under the JCL banner. 
Would love to hear everyone’s thoughts.
[11/3/25, 8:59:20 PM] Jay Baid Chandrapur: Great thought we should give it a try and i think it will lead us to something great!
[11/3/25, 10:06:52 PM] Raj Kothari: @⁨Pratik Kothari Chandrapur⁩ falcon giants se confirmation aaya kya?
@⁨Chintu Pugliya Bhaiyya⁩ aapki team confirm hai na?
[11/4/25, 1:28:47 PM] Raj Kothari: Few more ideas
1. Take permission to promote JCL through physical banners at Sthanak,Digambar Jain Mandir, Shwetambar Mandir, Dadi Wadi. 
2. Publicize Title and Co-Title sponsor on JCL’s official website. ⁠
 ⁠			Engage audiences through JCL quizzes, create leaderboards to track audience scores and keep prizes to the winners of those quizes at the presentation ceremony
			Create a JCL team builder on the website after auction that is a simulation for the audience members to create their own teams ( similar to Dream 11). Keep exciting prizes
[11/4/25, 1:32:49 PM] Raj Kothari: Aaj registration form circulate karna shuru kar dete hai. 3 Teams ka participation confirmed hai, 2 teams ka pending hai and 3 teams ka cancel hai. Matlab 3 spots definitely available hai. As discussed in the meeting, vacant slots will be given on first come first serve basis. Ek Ownership Guidelines ka document bana ke share karta hu.
